= Purser: a tool to check access permissions and preconditions on clouds


{doctitle} takes the credentials for a cloud providers API and checks several aspects against a list of expectations.
In its initial form, it is written to test the requirements the OpenShift 4 installer has for a Google Compute Platform project.

== Usage

Purser needs to now where to finde the service account keys.
To this by exporting the variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` pointing to the JSON file holding this data.

[source,bash]
--
purser gcp <project id> --domain <domain>
--

The `<project id>` can be passed in its numerical or human readable form.
You can find the project ID in the JSON file holding the service account key.

The domain is optional.
If set, validation will fail if the given domain is not a public managed zone within the validated project.
The domain has to be given as FQDN including the dot at the end.
